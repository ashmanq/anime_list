# The Anime App

The objective of this app was to create a multicomponent web application using the Vue.js framework that communicated with an API.

It carries out the following:

* The app uses the Jikan API to load a list of anime airing in the current season. 
* The list can be filtered by genre and is pagenated, with a drop down list allowing the user to select the number of items to show per page. 
* Selecting an anime will show you more details about it including the plot summary and air start date. 
* The details page gives you an option to add the app to a watch list. 
* The watchlist shows a graph listing the mix of genres of the anime in your watchlist.
